# VirtualArtsNotebookV3

The 3rd version of the Virtual Arts Notebook

The Visual Arts Notebook will be a digital notebook that will allow students and teachers to collect and collaborate on their art and existing art. The app aims to combine the benefits of having a personal drawing space that cannot be lost easily with the benefits of social media applications and forums. The app, in merging both worlds, will allow students to communicate with their classmates and teachers in order to get feedback on their work in a moderated setting.
